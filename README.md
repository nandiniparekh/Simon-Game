# Simon-Game
An interactive Simon Game written in jquery, HTML and CSS.

## Current Functionalities
A sound and "light up" animation that corresponds to each button plays both when the series of button presses plays, and when the player personally presses a button. <br>

Play runs on strict mode, where if a wrong button is pressed, the game ends. <br>

## Future add-ons
Play on normal mode, where if a wrong button is pressed, the game will let the player know, will play the series of button presses again, and will let the player try again. <br>

The game can be accessed on https://play-game-simon.netlify.app/.  <br>
